            <dt>1. How many national parks are there in total in the United States?
            </dt>
            <dd class="invisible">There are currently 63 national parks in the United
                States. The
                most
                recently established national park is New River Gorge National Park,
                located in West Virginia. The National Park System includes 423
                national park sites in total. These sites include memorials, national
                historic landmarks, heritage areas, etc. Most of the national parks are
                located in the western United States, in states such as California,
                Utah and Colorado.

            <dt>2. Which national parks are the most interesting and beautiful to
                visit?
            </dt>
            <dd class="invisible">We think that every national park is worth visiting.
                However,
                there
                are
                some national parks that are most unique in the world due to their
                geography. To get the best national park experience we recommend
                visiting the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, Zion,
                and Arches National Parks in the Western United States. Within the
                Eastern United States, the most famous ones are Acadia, Great Smoky
                Mountains, and Everglades. Check out our national park trip itineraries
                in different regions to get the best experience.
            </dd>
            <dt>3. Which national parks have the most visitors?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">The parks with the most overnight visitors are:
                Grand
                Canyon,
                Yosemite
                & Yellowstone. However, several national parks have only “day”
                visitors, making the national park feels empty during the evening and
                night. For national parks with a higher amount of overnight visitors we
                recommend making lodging and camping reservations in advance.
            </dd>
            <dt>4. In which national parks can I observe/see the most wild animals?
            </dt>
            <dd class="invisible">All national parks have wildlife from snakes and
                birds
                to
                larger
                animals, such as wolves, bears, moose and buffalo. To see the most
                wildlife we always recommend the National Parks that cover large forest
                areas such as Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Isle Royale, Rocky
                Mountain or Alaska’s Denali National Park. Yellowstone National Park in
                Wyoming is often referred to as the Serengeti of America because of its
                abundance of wildlife.

            <dt>5. Are there guided tours available? If so, any themed tours, such as
                wildlife, scenery, flowers, ect.?
            </dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Yes, each national park offers guided tours that can
                either be
                hosted
                by the National Park Service or by certified guides. The National Park
                Service mission includes to educate visitors about the uniqueness of
                each different park. To find those guided tours it is best to go to the
                visitor center or research for certified guides in gateway towns.
            </dd>
            <dt>6. How many people come to visit each year?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Last year there were 327 million national park visits
                in
                the
                United
                States. National Parks in the United States see a slow growth of
                national park visitation overall. Some national parks, like Zion, can
                become overcrowded during warmer months and require visitors to use
                park transportation rather than personal vehicles. Therefore, we
                recommend seasonal visitation during off-season months.
            </dd>
            <dt>7. Are there general rules when visiting a national park or does each
                park have specific ones?
            </dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Yes, there are general rules when visiting national
                parks
                and
                you
                will
                find this information under the official website. Also, each national
                park has specific rules that can change seasonally. For example, the
                rule of making a campfire may depend on drought conditions and the risk
                of wildfires.
            </dd>
            <dt>8. Where can I find a map of all parks and specific parks?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">We think the best way to see all national parks on a
                map
                is to
                use
                the
                Find Your Park website provided by the NPS. Many national parks have
                the official park map for downloads.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                9. How do I make reservations for camping or staying in national parks?
            </dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Most of the campsites in national parks and national
                forests
                are
                on a
                first-come first serve basis, however there is also the opportunity to
                make reservations online. We highly recommend making online
                reservations for popular national parks at least 3-5 months in advance.
            </dd>
            <dt>10. Can I drive into a national park? If so, do I need to pre-order an
                entrance ticket?
            </dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Most of the national parks in the United States are
                accessible
                by
                car,
                RV or bus. You can always enter a park and pay the individual fee at
                the park entrance. The fees vary between $20-$40 per vehicle and can be
                valid between 2 – 7 days. If you combine various national parks we
                recommend you buy the America the Beautiful Pass for $80.
