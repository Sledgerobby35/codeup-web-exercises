// =========== VARIABLES ===========

// Know about the purpose of variables in math?

// Yeah, it's the same idea here!

// A variable is a symbolic representative of a value that can be different in each run of a function

// What good is data if we don't have a way to pass around and use it in various ways?

// Introducing: variables!.... again!

// you have (in this order, left to right):
// the type of variable,
// the name of the variable,
// the assignment operator (=),
// and the value (in this case, a number)
//var num = 5; // now we have a variable we can use in other places!

// By declaring a variable, we are commanding the runtime (our language's engine for actually running the program)
// to reserve a bit of memory (RAM) for the value stored in said variable.'

// Well, how can we use it?
// Let's call a function (yes, still think in the math sense) which will use it to do something

// In this case, print it out to the user's console:
//console.log(num);

//Mini Exercise
// console.log(9);
// console.log(7);
// console.log(10);
// console.log("Hello");
// console.log("Codeup");
// console.log("Students");
// console.log(true);
// console.log(false);
// console.log(!true);
var num;
console.log(num);
